Many people don't know that negotiation is a science, and it is a course that a world-class university like Harvard will spend more than a semester teaching. Negotiations are everywhere in life. Negotiations are required for all transactions, salary negotiations, market value evaluation, conflict resolution, etc. If you learn this better negotiation technique, how much help will it be in your life? This article summarises the most recommended resource for learning negotiation technology in 2021. Through self-study, you can also become a negotiation expert!

## Albums and articles

Before you really start learning, maybe you can watch a photo album and relax. [SUITS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/). It's a legal-themed photo album, set in a law firm in New York. The storey starts with Mike Ross, who broke into the Harvey Spectre interview venue, without any lawyer's licence, persuading Harvey Spectre to admit him as the beginning.

The main selling point is the various commercial negotiations and the aura that Harvey Spectre showed in the negotiations. Although the series will deviate from the facts, watching the various performances of Harvey Spectre at the negotiating table will definitely make you feel more about the negotiation.

If you don’t have time to watch the series, there are also many articles on the Internet, sharing how to learn to negotiate like Harvey. E.g:

- [How To Negotiate Like Harvey Spectre Part I](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140814142934-347559225-how-to-negotiate-like-harvey-spectre/)
- [How To Negotiate Like Harvey Spectre Part II](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141204130253-347559225-how-to-negotiate-like-harvey-spectre-part-ii/)
- [6 Negotiation lessons from Harvey Spectre of ‘Suits’](https://www.scotwork.com.au/negotiation-blog/2018/6-negotiation-lessons-from-harvey-spectre-of-suits/)

In fact, there are too many articles and videos related to negotiations. Most of them list some guidelines. You might think, huh? Isn't it nonsense? Yes, a lot of it seems to be nonsense, but do you really take these guidelines and knowledge into consideration when you negotiate?

## Online course

After reading various articles and videos on the Internet, I start to feel a little bit about negotiation. At this time, I suggest that you can participate in these prestigious and popular recommended courses to learn the technology and knowledge of negotiation more systematically.
