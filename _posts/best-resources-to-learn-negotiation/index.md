Many people don’t realize that negotiation is a science, and world-class universities like Harvard dedicate more than a semester to teaching it. Negotiations are a part of everyday life, whether it’s transactions, salary discussions, market value evaluations, or conflict resolution. Imagine how much your life could improve by mastering better negotiation techniques. This article summarizes the top recommended resources for learning negotiation skills in 2021. Through self-study, you too can become a negotiation expert!

## TV Series and articles

Before you dive into learning, consider relaxing with a TV series. [SUITS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/) is a legal drama set in a New York law firm. The story begins with Mike Ross, who, without a law license, impressively convinces Harvey Specter to hire him after crashing an interview.

The main attraction of the show is the various business negotiations and the commanding presence Harvey Specter displays. While the series may deviate from reality, watching Harvey’s performances at the negotiating table will definitely give you a sense of effective negotiation techniques.

If you don’t have time to watch the series, there are many articles online that share insights on how to negotiate like Harvey. For example:

* [How To Negotiate Like Harvey Specter Part I](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140814142934-347559225-how-to-negotiate-like-harvey-specter/)
* [How To Negotiate Like Harvey Specter Part II](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141204130253-347559225-how-to-negotiate-like-harvey-specter-part-ii/)
* [6 Negotiation Lessons from Harvey Specter of ‘Suits’](https://www.scotwork.com.au/negotiation-blog/2018/6-negotiation-lessons-from-harvey-spectre-of-suits/)

There are countless articles and videos related to negotiations. Many of them list guidelines that might seem obvious. You might think, “Huh? Isn’t this common sense?” Yes, much of it may seem like common sense, but do you really consider these guidelines and knowledge when you negotiate?

## Online Courses

After reading various articles and watching videos on the Internet, you might start to get a feel for negotiation. At this point, I suggest participating in these prestigious and popular courses to learn negotiation techniques and knowledge more systematically. Below are the most recommended online negotiation courses in 2021:
