In addition, can search for front-end engineers on the Human Bank website and found about 20 job vacancies. The ones that appeared repeatedly more than 10 times would be the necessary technologies for job vacancies, mainly HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, React, and Other tools such as boostrap, jQuery, etc.

You can find high-quality introduction teaching on Youtube for almost every technology, or go to [Udemy Free Learning Center](https://tinyurl.com/yfbaghja) Find free related courses, find the highest number of views, the highest number of likes, and the way the instructor meets your appetite.

## Start Learning

You may hear some sayings, learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript, just look at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for yourself! Indeed, in the software world, most technologies are available Abundant resources are available for self-study, but as a novice, when you click in and look at the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) document, chances are you wonâ€™t see it for 30 minutes Just gave up.

It is recommended to let the lecturer lead you through the online course. The advantage of taking the course is that you can follow the instructor to operate and practice. In the process of implementation, you will accumulate a lot of sense of accomplishment. Seeing the pictures you make, you will have more ideas.

[The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://tinyurl.com/ydv2xz2w) is currently one of the most recommended courses for learning front-end basic concepts. Those who are completely inexperienced can follow it comfortably. The learning curve is smooth. Compared with other courses, the rate of students completing the course is very high. Follow the course to learn and implement. After the course, you will have a certain understanding of HTML/CSS/JS.

After you have a certain understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, you can continue to specialize in JavaScript. The most recommended on the Internet is [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://tinyurl.com/yemfgsgj), which is very suitable for people who want to understand JavaScript in-depth, and will talk about many advanced object prototypes, closures, etc. Ideas and many errors that JavaScript is easy to encounter, and how to avoid them. Through this course, you can have a solid understanding of the language features and underlying knowledge of JS, and you can also learn to build your own framework and understand the source code of well-known frameworks.

After laying the foundation, start to learn the front-end framework. If you have no idea, I suggest you learn React/Redux. [Stephen Grider](https://tinyurl.com/ydnr493j) is currently one of the most acclaimed lecturers, and his [Modern React with Redux](https://tinyurl.com/yehgynsv) is the most popular and must-buy Course. Through this course, you can quickly understand React and Redux, and you can quickly implement a small project, or you can design and implement your own work through the knowledge you have learned.

If you want to learn Vue, you can choose [Vue JS Essentials with Vuex and Vue Router](https://tinyurl.com/yjuz2mbs) from [Stephen Grider](https://tinyurl.com/yzp53825)

After learning, think about how to build a new work of your own through the techniques you have learned. Start from scratch. Don't rely on the sample code provided by too many courses. At the same time, you will find that your CSS knowledge and concepts are not enough. Solid, it is recommended to strengthen this course through [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://tinyurl.com/ykyldr97), and try to use more advanced skills in the project.

## Prepare for interviews

At this point, you are already a very competitive entry-level front-end engineer in the market. Start writing your resume, organizing your work, and preparing for a successful transfer!

At the same time, you can go back and see [Frontend Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#frontend-roadmap), understand what you are now, what is missing. Also, as much as possible, understand everything that has been learned and the future should be learned, and the role of those technologies. This will be very helpful for continuous study and interview preparation.
