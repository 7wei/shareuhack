As long as you work hard, are willing to save, and follow discipline, even if you start slowly, everyone can achieve wealth freedom. Find ways to diversify risks, diversify investment, seek advice from people who are trustworthy, prepare appropriate hedging methods, and respond to different market cycles.

It mentions a way to diversify investment: divide your funds into three buckets,

1. Security bucket: The most conservative investment, capital preservation, such as bonds.
2. Growth bucket: more risk, more rate of return, such as the stock market.
3. Dream bucket: Put part of the income from other investments into the Dream bucket and try the life you want to experience more!

> If you want to change your life, you have to change your strategy, you have to change your story and you have to change your state

In the real world, people’s financial decisions are always more irrational than expected. Many decisions, such as when you are about to go bankrupt, betting a lot of lotteries, using leveraged gambling, etc., are very irrational, but For the individual, this action seems to make some sense. The same is true for investment. People's investment is usually influenced by their own life experience and personality, rather than a calm analysis of the market situation. For example, those who have experienced financial turmoil and those who have been stable and long-term as soon as they entered the market have very different investment strategies and ideas. The total decision actually involves many psychological factors.

> No all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.

We should learn to understand the fact that success requires luck, and learn to fear losing what we already have, and manage risks. Don't be greedy, not only didn't make a small amount of money but instead lost the cost of survival.

> Life isn't any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it's said, is just results minimus expectations.

So, how to maintain the original wealth? History tells us that people who can survive in the market for a long time have one thing in common, called fear, which prevents them from being eliminated by the market. When you learn to be afraid of losing what you already have, you will have a different perspective and may have the opportunity to make better decisions.

Failure is inevitable. From another perspective, failure is the only way to success. Accept it. Every small failure will lay the foundation for more success. Every small success will enable you to bear greater fail.

### Keynotes

1. Everyone has their own experience of the market and money
2. Personal experience affects financial decisions
3. The economic concepts we currently use are still very immature
4. The proportion of luck to financial success is much higher than you think
5. Rather than sticking to a specific case, try more broad and diversified methods to get more possibilities
6. Jealousy makes you reckless
7. It is easier to accumulate wealth than to maintain wealth
8. You may be wrong half of your time and decision-making, but you can still accumulate wealth

## Conclusion

In fact, there are many books on the market related to money, financial management and investment. This time I will choose these three books for sharing, mainly because the concepts of these three books are relatively solid and stable, suitable for most of us "ordinary people", many concepts You may have heard, for example: prepare emergency reserves, the power of compound interest, do not use leveraged investment, etc. But the market opportunities are unlimited, and now there is so much flooding information on the Internet, it is easy to cause FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), deep I was afraid that I did not keep up with the car, entered the market suddenly, and even borrowed money to invest in high-risk projects. The market is indeed endless, and many masters can indeed seize these opportunities. But for ordinary people, it is perhaps the most important thing to lay a solid foundation, lay the foundation of a better life, and then seek better opportunities.
