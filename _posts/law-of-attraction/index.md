You’ve probably heard of the Law of Attraction, popularized by Rhonda Byrne’s book *The Secret*. This book sold over five million copies within four months of its release and has been translated into 40 languages, becoming a classic on the topic. The author explains that our thoughts emit a frequency that attracts similar frequencies. Just like a magnet, we attract what we think about into our lives. This is the Law of Attraction.

But did you know that practicing the Law of Attraction requires some techniques to make your desires come true more easily? Today, we'll share three steps to effectively harness the Law of Attraction. If you have new goals or dreams this year, let’s bravely place our orders with the universe together!

## Step 1: Positive Thinking + Affirmative Statements for Clear Desires

As mentioned in *The Secret*, "To change your circumstances, you must first change your thoughts." When making a wish, be sure to use positive thinking and affirmative statements to express your clear desires. For example, when changing to a new job and hoping to meet good colleagues or supervisors, your thoughts and wishes should be: "I believe I will meet great teammates!" (affirming the positive) instead of "I hope I don’t meet bad coworkers!" (avoiding negative thoughts). Or, if you want to save money to buy a house, your wish should be: "I will definitely buy this house by the age of XX" (affirming self-achievement) instead of "It might take a long time for my savings to buy this house" (expressing uncertainty). Remember to avoid using negative or doubtful statements. Dare to imagine and affirm that it will happen; this increases the chance of your wish coming true. Moreover, the clearer your wish, the easier it is to achieve. For instance, "I want to get richer" versus "I want to increase my income by $5,000 every month." The latter is more likely to be achieved!

## Step 2: Visualize Your Desires and Anticipate the Joy of Realization

After making a wish, write down or print your desire and place it somewhere visible in your daily life (setting it as your phone or computer wallpaper is also a good method). This process is called visualization. Visualization helps transform what you think into visible reality. When you see it often, you will be more confident that you are moving towards your dream.

Additionally, imagine the joy and excitement you will feel when your wish is realized! For example, if you wish to buy a house by the age of XX, picture yourself living in that ideal home with a beautiful forest view outside and a clean, comfortable interior. The satisfaction of living in your dream home will make you feel happy. Don’t forget, your emotions generate frequencies for the universe, and good feelings naturally attract good frequencies to you. Always take a moment to feel the happiness in your heart.

## Step 3: Focus on Your Desires + Continuous Effort, and Wait for Your Wish to Come True

The Law of Attraction is not just about whimsical thinking but a form of self-enhancement. Besides making a wish, you must focus on your goals and desires and make corresponding efforts. The process is more important than the result. For example, if you wish to find an ideal partner, you must first take the step to meet new people and write down the qualities you seek in a partner. After taking the first step, people with similar qualities will gradually come closer to you, and your wish will slowly come true!

## The Law of Attraction Happened to Me! A Real-Life Example Shared by a Friend:

In college, my psychology professor asked the class to write down their ideal job or life state five years after graduation. Studying administrative sciences and having a passion for music, I constantly thought about how I excelled in one field and loved the other. I wrote that I hoped to work in public service after graduation and pursue music-related activities on weekends.

As I wrote, I smiled and imagined such a wonderful life. It was just perfect! In my second year after graduation, I focused on civil service exams and tutoring. One day, a friend told me, "I saw a public department offering a contract position on a website. You should apply. The job content seems related to your major, and you might have a chance!"

While preparing for exams, I decided to give it a try. I successfully got the position and started a year of public service work. However, this experience made me realize that I didn’t enjoy the work mode in the public sector and felt a bit unhappy. My thoughts started drifting back to my passion for music.

After the contract ended, I decided to switch to a different field and began looking for a new job online. About four months later, something magical happened! One day, a music company I had always dreamed of working for posted a job opening. It was an administrative position matching my work experience, and I immediately applied. Eventually, I got the job and entered my dream music company, combining my administrative skills with my passion. Interestingly, I realized that I joined this company exactly five years after graduation, just as if the universe had planned it all!

## The Fascination of the Law of Attraction

In the book *The Alchemist*, it is mentioned, "When you truly desire something, the whole universe will conspire to help you achieve it." The most amazing aspect of the Law of Attraction is that when you have negative thoughts, unfortunate things often happen. But when you sincerely desire something and believe from the bottom of your heart that you will have it, putting in the effort to achieve it, you will ultimately get what you want. If you have ever failed in making a wish, ask yourself if your mindset was firm or if you didn't truly believe in it. Things you don’t believe in will never come true. "The outcome is often determined by your mindset and thoughts." By maintaining a positive and proactive attitude, you can effectively use the Law of Attraction, successfully place orders with the universe, and make your desires come true one by one! Let's place orders with the universe in the new year and feel the joy of making our wishes come true!
