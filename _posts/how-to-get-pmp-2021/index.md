Those who are following these PMP licenses may find that the PMP exam will be revised in 2021, so the articles about sharing PMP exam photos that are searched now may be different from the latest situation. But don’t worry, haven’t you found this article?

## What is PMP？

Please just check the official [PMP introduction](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp)。

## How to apply for the PMP exam?

For any information related to PMP registration, please go to the [PMI official website](https://www.pmi.org/) first to ensure that the information is the most current and correct. Refer to the official PMI [How to Apply for the PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp/earn-the-pmp/how-to-apply), in short, you will need First confirm whether you are eligible to register for the exam, then register an account with PMI and start applying.

### Step 1 Check if you are eligible

The following two sets of conditions can meet one of them:

First group:

1. Possess a 4-year bachelor's degree
2. Have 36 months of experience in leading projects
3. Received 35 hours of project management training

Second Group:

1. Possess a high school diploma or Associates degree
2. Has 60 months of experience in leading projects
3. Received 35 hours of project management training

### Step 2 Register an account at pmi.org and start the application process

It may be annoying to fill in the form, but I still hope that everyone who wants to take the exam can independently follow the instructions on the website to apply. After all, as a professional project manager, this should be a very basic skill, right?

Among them, it is worth mentioning that you will need to fill in the project experience when registering for the exam. You can refer to PMI's [Your PMP Application Checklist](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/your-pmp-application-checklist.pdf?v=598ade6b-8bd6-4ef5-a7d6-1d363a2b93d0), as a basis for data preparation.

If you are sure you want to get a PMP license, We suggest joining a paid member after registering an account. You will need to pay a membership fee of US$129/year and a one-time application fee of US$10. The main advantage is that the exam fee for members is US It’s $405 instead of US$555 for non-members. In fact, it’s a bit less expensive to add members. In addition, the most important point is that members can download the pdf file of the PMBOK® Guide for free.

## What has changed in the 2021 PMP exam? Why?

Because the role of the project manager and the way and thinking of project management have evolved over time.

PMI will continue to observe and analyze the work content and methods of the project manager, and review whether the knowledge content of the exam is out of date and needs to be updated. For example, PMI wants to emphasize agile management more than the previous version, which only focused on predictive waterfall, and this is also reflected in the updated version of the exam.

The old version of the exam content is more limited to the project cycle of project management. The new version of the exam content will focus on the following three domains:

1. People (42%): Strong soft skills to lead the team to adapt to today's rapidly changing environment and embrace change!
2. Process (50%): Emphasize the technology of project management
3. Business Environment (8%): ​​Emphasize the link between the project and the organizational strategy

This change is something we are happy to see. Faced with the current dynamic environment, the domain that the new version focuses on is indeed much closer to the status quo. We can expect that the new version of the exam will have more situational questions related to the above three domains, and there will also be more agile or hybrid concepts. According to the official statement, half of the questions will be predictive and the other half will be agile/ hybrid.

## PMBOK 6 vs PMBOK 7

You may have noticed that PMBOK 7 was officially published a few weeks ago. If it was originally prepared with PMBOK 6, what should I do to deal with it?

The answer is, no.

So far, the official still takes the sixth edition as the [reference list](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp/earn-the-pmp/pmp-exam-preparation/pmp-reference-list?utm_campaign=2021-07-19&utm_term=8912846&utm_content=educational&utm_source=email-sendgrid&utm_medium=979552), and PMBOK is originally just one of the reference books, please rest assured to prepare according to the following methods.

The main difference between PMBOK 6 and 7 is that compared with the ten knowledge areas (Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder) that focus on the project management process in the sixth edition, the seventh edition has been revised. To strengthen the overall performance adjustment (Team, Stakeholders, Life cycle, Planning, Uncertainty and ambiguity, Delivery, Performance, Project work)
