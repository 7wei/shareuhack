<!-- en-US -->

Anyone interested in obtaining the PMP certification should be aware that the exam was revised in 2021. Therefore, older articles about the PMP exam may not reflect the latest information. Don’t worry, this article will introduce an overview of the revisions and provide a guide to obtaining the new PMP certification!

## What is PMP?

This article will not elaborate on what PMP is. If you’re interested, please refer directly to the PMI official [Introduction](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp).

## How to apply for the PMP exam?

For any information related to PMP registration, always refer to the [PMI official website](https://www.pmi.org/) to ensure the information is up-to-date and accurate. You can refer to PMI’s [how-to guide](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp/earn-the-pmp/how-to-apply) for more details. 

Here is a simplified summary of what you will need:

1. Confirm eligibility for the exam.
2. Register an account on the PMI website.
3. Start the application process.

### Step 1: Confirm Eligibility

You must meet one of the following sets of criteria:

First set:

1. A four-year bachelor’s degree.
2. 36 months of leading project experience.
3. 35 hours of project management education.

Second set:

1. A high school diploma or an associate degree.
2. 60 months of leading project experience.
3. 35 hours of project management education.

### Step 2: Register an Account on pmi.org and Start the Application Process

Filling out forms can be tedious, but I encourage all candidates to independently follow the website instructions to apply. After all, as a professional project manager, this should be a basic skill, right?


One thing worth mentioning is that you will need to document your project experience when applying for the exam. You can refer to PMI’s [Your PMP Application Checklist](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/your-pmp-application-checklist.pdf?v=598ade6b-8bd6-4ef5-a7d6-1d363a2b93d0) as a basis for preparing your materials.

If you are determined to obtain the PMP certification, it is recommended to join as a paying member after registering your account. The membership fee is US$129/year with a one-time application fee of US$10. The main benefit is that the exam fee for members is US$405, compared to US$555 for non-members, so joining as a member is actually more economical. Additionally, most importantly, members can download the PMBOK® Guide PDF for free.

## What Changes Were Made to the PMP Exam Starting in 2021 and Why?

The role of project managers, as well as project management methods and thinking, are continuously evolving over time.

PMI continuously observes and analyzes the work content and methods of project managers and reviews whether the exam knowledge content is outdated and needs updating. For example, the old version focused only on the predictive waterfall model, but the new version emphasizes agile management more, reflecting this in the updated exam.

The old exam content was limited to the project lifecycle, emphasizing five processes, ten knowledge areas, and various sub-processes. The new exam content focuses on the following three domains:

1. People (42%): Emphasizes leadership soft skills to adapt to today’s fast-changing environment and embrace change!
2. Process (50%): Emphasizes the techniques of managing projects.
3. Business Environment (8%): Emphasizes the link between the project and organizational strategy.

This change is welcomed. Facing the dynamic changing environment, the new focus on these domains indeed reflects the current situation better. We can expect more scenario-based questions related to these three domains in the new exam, with more concepts related to agile or hybrid approaches. According to the official statement, half of the questions will be in a predictive manner, while the other half will be agile/hybrid.

## PMBOK 6 vs. PMBOK 7

The official PMBOK 7 has been published. What should you do if you prepared using PMBOK 6?

The answer is, nothing needs to be done.

So far, the official exam reference list still uses the sixth edition. PMBOK has always been just one of the references. You can rest assured to follow the preparation methods below.

The main differences between PMBOK 6 and 7 are:

1. Inclusion of Systems Thinking to enhance the holistic view of project management.
2. Emphasis on value delivery over outcomes.
3. The sixth edition emphasizes ten knowledge areas (Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder), while the seventh edition emphasizes eight project performance domains (Team, Stakeholders, Life cycle, Planning, Uncertainty and ambiguity, Delivery, Performance, Project work).

## Preparation Methods

How should you prepare for the new exam?

For new candidates, the preparation methods are not significantly different. Attend the necessary courses and thoroughly read the materials. These materials will be updated according to the latest PMI rules. Here are the recommended preparation methods:

### Preparation Materials

1. [PMP Examination Content Outline](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/pmp-examination-content-outline.pdf?v=ef41743a-9156-4137-a9a6-fd31e19a9668): The official exam outline provided by PMP, which details the exam content.

2. PMI Official PMBOK 6 + 7 + APG (Agile Practice Guide): PMI members can download the PDF files for free.

3. [PMP Exam Prep Seminar-2021 Exam Content with 35 PDUs](https://tinyurl.com/yfen2p3g "affiliate"): Joseph Phillips’ course on Udemy. By completing the course, assignments, and tests, you can earn 35 PDUs, which meet the basic training requirements for applying for the PMP exam. The instructor continuously updates the latest PMP-related content, so there’s no need to worry about outdated information. After reviewing the course, it is clear and easy to understand, even for those without a strong professional background. However, experienced project managers might find it somewhat less engaging. It is recommended to quickly go through the course to gain PDUs and get an overview of the knowledge framework.

4. [PMP Exam Cram Session-Updated for the current PMP Exam](https://tinyurl.com/yzgyqkyg "affiliate"): Another course by Joseph on Udemy, similar to a cram session, includes 135 practice questions.

5. [PMP Exam-PMI New Format 2024 Mock Simulator (PMBOK7 Updated)](https://tinyurl.com/yn7bdabm "affiliate"): Simulation questions for PMBOK 7, providing more practice questions on AGILE/HYBRID/PREDICTIVE aspects.

### Preparation method

1. First, go through the [PMP Examination Content Outline](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/pmp-examination-content-outline.pdf?v=ef41743a-9156-4137-a9a6-fd31e19a9668) to understand the exam outline and scope. If you have some project management experience, you should feel relieved after reading it, realizing that these questions won’t be too challenging for you.

2. Complete the [PMP Exam Prep Seminar - Complete Exam Coverage with 35 PDUs](https://tinyurl.com/yfen2p3g) course to learn the entire knowledge framework and earn enough PDUs to apply for the exam. It is also recommended to skim through the PMBOK. For experienced project managers, this content will be a breeze, but you still need to familiarize yourself with the system’s terminology. Adjust the course speed to 1.5x to finish it faster. Depending on individual circumstances, this course can typically be completed within 1-2 months.

3. Quickly review the official materials again. After completing the course, your grasp of the knowledge system should be strong. There’s no need to go into too much detail. Refer back to the materials as needed when practicing questions.

4. Start practicing simulation questions. There are many free test resources available online. Below are some listed resources. When practicing, don’t focus too much on whether each answer is correct. The key is to have a clear understanding of the questions. If there are unclear parts, refer back to the PMBOK or discuss in related [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/839989579444112) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/groups/?keywords=PMP) groups. Communities are usually willing to help. As for how many questions you need to practice, the ones listed in this article’s learning resources are sufficient. Additional practice is mainly to boost confidence and reduce anxiety.

5. Before the exam, do a final review with the [PMP Exam Cram Session - Updated for the current PMP Exam](https://tinyurl.com/yzgyqkyg) and practice with the [PMP Exam-PMI New Format 2024 Mock Simulator (PMBOK7 Updated)](https://tinyurl.com/yn7bdabm). This preparation will ensure you can take the exam confidently.
