<!-- en-US -->

The PMP certification exam was last updated in 2021. Therefore, if you're trying to find information related to it, it's probably outdated. No worries. The article will guide you through the revision of PMP and help you prepare for the PMP exam!

## What is PMP?

It assumes you already know and is interested in this certification, so I won't go into too much detail about it. Those who are unfamiliar with this exam may want to consult the official PMI [Introduction](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp).

## How to apply for the PMP exam?

Rules change. For the latest information, Please check the [PMI official website](https://www.pmi.org/). PMI has a [how-to guide]((https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp/earn-the-pmp/how-to-apply)) on how to apply for the PMP. In short, you need to:

1. Confirm whether you are eligible for the exam
2. Go to PMI to register an account and
3. Start application

### Step 1 Check if you are eligible

The following two sets of conditions can meet one of them:

First group:

1. Possess a 4-year bachelor's degree
2. Have 36 months of experience in leading projects
3. Received 35 hours of project management training

Second Group:

1. Possess a high school diploma or Associates degree
2. Has 60 months of experience in leading projects
3. Received 35 hours of project management training

### Step 2 Register an account at pmi.org and start the application process

Although filling out the form may be bothersome, I still recommend all applicants follow the instructions on the website to apply independently. As a professional project manager, shouldn't this be a basic skill?


Please note that you will need to fill in the project experience when registering for the exam. You can refer to PMI's [Your PMP Application Checklist](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/your-pmp-application-checklist.pdf?v=598ade6b-8bd6-4ef5-a7d6-1d363a2b93d0), as the reference for data preparation.

If you are sure you get to earn a PMP certification, it is recommended to join a paid member after registering an account. You will need to pay a membership fee of US$129/year and a one-time application fee of US$10. The main advantage is that the exam fee for members is US$405 For non-members, it costs US$555. It saves a little bit. In addition, members can download the pdf file of PMBOK®Guide, for free!

## What has changed in the PMP exam in 2021? Why does it need to be updated?

Because the role of the project manager and the way and the concept of project management has evolved.

PMI will continue to observe and analyze the work and methodology of the project manager and review whether the content of the exam is out of date. For example, the old version only focused on predictive waterfall models. To be more timely, the new version puts more focus on agile management, which is also reflected in the updated version of the exam.

Compare with the old version of the exam which is relatively limited to the project cycle of project management, emphasizing the five major processes, ten knowledge areas, and each sub-process, the new version of the exam content will focus on the following three domains:

1. People (42%): Strong soft skills to lead the team to adapt to today's rapidly changing environment and embrace change!
2. Process (50%): Emphasize the technology of project management
3. Business Environment (8%): ​​Emphasize the link between the project and the organizational strategy

We are happy to see these changes. It's an agile era, what the new version focuses on is indeed much fit with the current status. We can expect that the new version of the exam will have more situational questions related to the above three domains, and there will also be more agile or hybrid concepts. According to the official statement, half of the questions will be predictive and the other half will be agile/ hybrid.

## PMBOK 6 vs PMBOK 7

You may have noticed that PMBOK 7 was officially published a few weeks ago. If it was originally prepared with PMBOK 6, what should I do to deal with it?

The answer is, no.

So far, the official still takes the sixth edition as the [reference list](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp/earn-the-pmp/pmp-exam-preparation/pmp-reference-list?utm_campaign=2021-07-19&utm_term=8912846&utm_content=educational&utm_source=email-sendgrid&utm_medium=979552), and PMBOK is originally just one of the reference books. You can prepare it in the following way.

The main difference between PMBOK 6 and 7 is that compared with the ten knowledge areas (Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder) that focus on the project management process in the sixth edition, the seventh edition has changed To strengthen the overall performance adjustment (Team, Stakeholders, Life cycle, Planning, Uncertainty and ambiguity, Delivery, Performance, Project work)
