After being promoted from a junior position to management, many find themselves overwhelmed with endless tasks and the added responsibility of managing team members. Unfortunately, company training programs often don't teach time management skills, leaving this crucial skill as a personal responsibility.

Some people have mastered time management from their student days, while others struggle with it even in middle age. This article introduces the four quadrants of basic time management to help you take the first step toward effective time management.

## Time Management: A Crucial Skill for Managers

The four-quadrant time management method, proposed by [Stephen Richards Covey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey), is especially relevant for new managers. They need to handle pressure from superiors while managing subordinates' workload and progress. Mastering time management is essential.

Before introducing the four quadrants, consider your daily tasks. Eliminate unnecessary tasks and delegate those that can be handled by team members. As President Roosevelt said, "To gain more time, you must first eliminate time wasters." Streamlining tasks is key to effective time management.

## Urgent and Important Tasks: Apply the 80/20 Rule

Tasks that are both urgent and important fall into the first quadrant. These tasks often bring significant benefits or involve crucial relationships. New managers should use the 80/20 rule, dedicating most resources and manpower to handling these tasks. Allocate resources carefully, demonstrating determination and ability to complete critical tasks.

Even if urgent and important tasks prevent you from completing non-urgent or less important tasks, prioritize accordingly. Time management teaches us that if a task isn't meaningful, spending a lot of time on it is just busywork.

To handle urgent and important tasks efficiently, consider using the Pomodoro Technique or other methods to enhance focus. Studies show that reducing the time spent on critical tasks shortens overall work hours.

## Important but Not Urgent Tasks: Approach with Care

Some tasks may not be urgent now but have future deadlines. These tasks should not be prioritized by urgency but completed smartly. Careful planning of daily progress is recommended.

Procrastination is common with important tasks. Procrastinators often feel anxious and out of control, leading to delays. In contrast, self-control—the ability to regulate one's actions—is key to overcoming procrastination.

New managers should distribute important but non-urgent tasks across different times while managing progress and content. This is crucial for effective management. Use project management tools like Trello or Gantter to track progress and avoid overlooking details.

## Not Important but Urgent Tasks: Avoid Getting Distracted

Some tasks may be urgent but not important, often leaving new managers unsure of what to do. For example, the CEO might request a report by the end of the day, or a colleague might ask for help with a trivial matter. These tasks can disrupt your original plans.

When faced with urgent but unimportant tasks, consider if the consequences of not completing them are severe or if there are alternative ways to compensate. If the task is not absolutely necessary and completing it urgently would disrupt your schedule, weigh the extra cost.

If the task must be completed, leverage management skills by delegating or seeking assistance. Proper delegation is a core value of management. If you cannot delegate and the task is unmanageable, consider saying no.

## Not Important and Not Urgent Tasks: Can They Be Ignored?

Many time management books suggest ignoring tasks that are neither important nor urgent. However, these tasks still deserve review and reflection. If they appear on your to-do list, they must have some value. Evaluating the reasons behind them can improve your time management skills.

Seemingly trivial tasks can be what sets you apart in achieving higher management levels. As David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, said, "Small things make big things happen. Details create perfection." New managers should consider delegating these tasks to others within the allowable workload. Subordinates might unexpectedly find value in what you deemed trivial.

## Drawbacks of the Four-Quadrant Time Management Method?

The four-quadrant method is just the foundation of time management. Some tasks may change constantly depending on time or circumstances. What is urgent and important today might become trivial tomorrow, or priorities may shift based on board meeting outcomes. In such cases, the method might not be sufficient.

As a widely popular time management strategy for decades, try categorizing your current tasks using the four quadrants. If you encounter problems that the four-quadrant method can't solve, consider breaking them down into smaller tasks or creating a "fifth quadrant" for special cases, developing a personalized time management approach.
