After being promoted to the management level, many people have to share the time to take care of their subordinates, facing unfinished work. However, the company's training system usually does not teach you how to do a good job of time management, because this is each employee's own homework.
Some people have been able to make good use of time management since they were students, creating a regular life and the importance of adjusting things. Some people have entered middle age and still have no way to master their time. They can only let work disrupt the pace of their lives. In this article, we will introduce the four most basic time management quadrants so that you can take the first step in time management.

## Compulsory credits for time management and novice supervisors

The four-quadrant rule of time management was proposed by the famous American management scientist [Stephen Richards Covey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey). The importance of time management is self-evident, and it must be special for novice supervisors. I feel like I can use it for 48 hours a day. After all, as a middle-level manager, you have to deal with the pressure of your boss, and you must also be able to grasp the working status and progress of your subordinates. Time management is definitely the first course for novice supervisors.
Before starting the introduction of the four quadrants, you can think about the daily tasks in your work, and try to delete unnecessary tasks and tasks that can be assigned to subordinates. US President Roosevelt once said: "To gain more time, we must first eliminate wasting time." If you don't streamline your work, no amount of time management methods can help you.

## Urgent and important things match 82 rules

The most important thing to deal with is to be in the first quadrant. It is also urgent and important to do. It is often accompanied by huge interests or interpersonal relationships. As a novice supervisor, you should make good use of the 82 rule and take most of the Manpower and resources are invested in handling this part of the work. Allocate the resources carefully to show your determination and courage to do your best.
It should be noted that even if other non-urgent or unimportant things cannot be completed because of urgent and important things, you must make a choice and make urgent and important things the first priority. Time management tells us that if what is done is meaningless, then even if it takes a lot of time, it is just pretending to be busy.
Concentrate on dealing with urgent and important things. You can use the Pomodoro Technique to improve work efficiency or other work rules that can improve concentration to efficiently complete the first quadrant. Facts have proved that shortening the working hours of the most important and urgent matters is the best way to reduce the total working time.

## Important but not urgent things should be done carefully

Although some things are not urgent at the moment, there will still be time limits at some time in the future. Things in the second quadrant have no priority but should be done in a smart way. Carefully planning the progress of each day is a recommended way of doing things.
It should be noted that due to human inertia, the more important things are more likely to be procrastinated. People who procrastinate are often anxious and have a sense of uncertainty and difficulty in controlling what to do, so they procrastinate. The opposite of procrastination is self-control-the ability to control oneself.

## Not important but urgency often makes us mess up

Although some things are urgent, they may not be so important. For such chores, novice supervisors are often overwhelmed. For example, the general manager temporarily confessed to providing a report before leaving get off work, or daily chores from a good colleague, which may disrupt the original With work or planning at hand, you suddenly don’t know what to do.
Should unimportant but urgent things be listed as priorities? This is the most frequently asked question of the four-quadrant management method. It is recommended that when encountering this kind of trivial work, first seriously think about whether the consequences of not dealing with this matter are very serious, or it can be compensated by other means. It is not necessary to complete it in such an urgent time, or even disrupt the original Time planning may require additional costs.
If after careful evaluation, the judgment still has to be completed, then for this kind of thing, you should play the value of the management, allocate appropriate work or ask others to help you deal with it, don't carry all the work yourself, after all, how to properly Local distribution of work is also one of the core values ​​of being a supervisor. If you encounter something that cannot be handed over to others for assistance, you can't handle it in time. It may be one way to bravely refuse the job.

## Can things that are not important and urgent can really be ignored?

In many time management books, things that are not important or urgent are often not worth the time to do, but in fact, these things should also take time to examine and reflect. Since these items will appear on your to-do list, they must have their meaning and value. Only by bravely evaluating the reasons behind can you become a perfect time manager.
The devil tends to hide in the details. It seems unimportant or urgent, but it is often the final point of perfection to elevate one's workability to a higher level of management. David Packard, the founder of Hewlett-Packard in the United States, said: "Little things make great things, and details make perfect." As a novice supervisor, you can also try to assign these things to other subordinates. Within the scope allowed by the workload, subordinates may also be used. Use the unimportant chores that you consider to be of unexpected value.

## Disadvantages of the four-quadrant method of time management?

The four-quadrant method is only a basic introduction to time management. Some tasks may change continuously with time or environmental conditions. Today is a very urgent and important matter, but after today, it will become unimportant and not urgent or will change with time. It will change according to the results of the directors’ meeting, but the situation cannot be ignored until then.
As an important time management method that has been popular for decades, first try to classify the work at hand. If you encounter a problem that cannot be solved by the four-quadrant rule of time management, you can try to disassemble it into several different tasks. , You can also create a "fifth quadrant" that belongs to the special job at hand, treat a small amount of work as a special example, and create your own time management rules!
