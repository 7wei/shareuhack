If you want to learn something new, the first online course platform you might think of is [Udemy](https://tinyurl.com/yhdgtddt). You can find almost any course imaginable here, for example, language, art, music, fitness, programming, business, teaching, productivity, and more. So, how can you buy [Udemy](https://tinyurl.com/yhdgtddt) courses at the cheapest price?

## Udemy Pricing

The price of Udemy courses ranges from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars, depending on the pricing set by individual instructors. However, overall, the cost of the courses is quite reasonable. Udemy courses come with lifetime access and a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, so if there's a specific course you like, you can buy it and use it as your personal learning library.

## Udemy Saving Strategies

### 1. Udemy Free Learning Center

The most cost-effective way is to browse the [Udemy Free Learning Center](https://tinyurl.com/yfbaghja). Free courses are usually not in-depth, but they can serve as a great introduction or resource library. It is recommended to use the filter criteria to find highly-rated courses. Many instructors offer more than one course, so you can start with a free course to see if the instructor’s style matches your learning preferences.

### 2. Udemy Special Offers

"What? Isn't Udemy always on sale?"

Udemy does have special prices from time to time, but there will be times when the original price is restored. Unless it is urgent, do not buy courses at full price!

Add the course to your [Wish List](https://tinyurl.com/yf8sak6b) and check back later to see if a discount is available. You can also watch for special offer emails from Udemy.

### 3. Holiday Special Offers

During certain holidays, Udemy usually offers special deals. Keep an eye out for discounts around Valentine's Day, Teacher's Day, Black Friday, and other major holidays.

### 4. Turn on Udemy's Promotion Notifications

Enable promotion notifications to ensure you don't miss any discount opportunities. It is also recommended to subscribe to the announcements of the course instructors. Good instructors often update their courses with the latest relevant knowledge and news, which can be very beneficial.

### 5. 30-Day Unconditional Refund

Refer to the [Udemy Terms of Use](https://tinyurl.com/yzly7hek). If a course does not meet your expectations, you can request a refund unconditionally. It is not encouraged to abuse the refund mechanism, and Udemy will review any suspected abuse. However, if the course does not meet your expectations or the quality is poor,​⬤
