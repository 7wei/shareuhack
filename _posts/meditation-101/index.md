“Meditation,” simply put, is like a “mental housecleaning.” It is a process of focusing your mind that can also achieve relaxation, clearing away mental clutter, and bringing a restless mind back to calm. This article provides five guidelines for beginners, teaching you how to meditate successfully and experience the transformative changes it can bring!

## What Is Meditation? You Might Need It Too!

In this age of information overload, studies estimate that modern people need to receive and process up to 36,000 GB of information daily. This information overload impacts our brains and lives, making it hard to quiet our minds, even before bed, like countless open browser tabs that won’t close. Over time, this leads to life stress, poor sleep quality, anxiety, difficulty concentrating at work, and other negative emotions that indirectly affect our physical and mental health and overall quality of life.

If you have experienced these symptoms, why not try meditation? Rediscover the happiness of inner peace!

## The Benefits of Meditation, Even Endorsed by Celebrities

Scientific research has found that long-term meditation can increase the thickness of the prefrontal cortex and the right anterior brain cortex, areas that control attention and perception, making the brain more agile and inspired. It also strengthens self-awareness, relieves stress, improves resilience and memory, and maintains inner peace.

NBA star LeBron James is a meditation enthusiast. About meditation, James said, “It was a bit strange at first because it’s a whole new practice that requires detachment, but meditation really makes me feel more comfortable, mentally and energetically.” Microsoft founder Bill Gates and talk show host Oprah Winfrey are also practitioners of meditation. Google even includes “meditation” as an official course for employees. Curious about the power of meditation yet?

Follow the five guidelines below and start meditating together!

## Five Guidelines for Meditation Beginners

1. **Meditation Location**: Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed, where you feel comfortable and safe. It could be on your bed, the sofa in the living room, or an open grassy area. Remember to turn off all devices and noise that could distract you (TV, phone notifications).

2. **Meditation Posture**: There are many postures for meditation—standing, sitting in a chair, cross-legged, or even lying down. Beginners are advised to start sitting in a chair or cross-legged. When sitting cross-legged, keep your back straight without leaning against a wall (to avoid falling asleep during meditation), and place your hands lightly on your thighs. Closing your eyes can help you focus and enter a state of calm.

3. **Meditation Duration**: Beginners can start with 5 minutes per session, gradually increasing the time to a maximum of 20 minutes. Set a timer before meditating so you can focus on your breathing and ignore the passage of time.

4. **Starting Meditation**: Beginners can practice the easiest “observational meditation.” Close your eyes and start by “focusing on your breath.” After taking 3-4 deep breaths through your nose and exhaling slowly, relax your body and naturally follow your breathing rhythm to enter meditation. During meditation, feel the changes in your breath and the rise and fall of your abdomen with each inhale and exhale. Focus on your breath as an “observer,” experiencing each breath without any emotion until the time ends.

5. **Best Times for Meditation**: Meditating before work and before bed is ideal, allowing you to establish a regular practice. Meditating before work helps improve concentration and efficiency throughout the day, while meditating before bed clears all the day’s distractions, like shutting down a computer, calming your mind, and aiding sleep.

## What Makes a Successful Meditation Session?

Beginners often ask, “What counts as a successful meditation session?”

As a beginner, your mind will inevitably be filled with various thoughts during meditation, such as: “Why hasn’t the time passed yet?”, “What should I eat later?”, or “Feeling anxious about unfinished work from the day…” Do not feel frustrated or discouraged—this is normal.

When these thoughts arise, imagine yourself as an observer standing by a window, watching the sky. The thoughts are like clouds passing by your window. You don’t need to push them away; just watch them quietly until they drift away.

In the same way, during meditation, simply “observe and become aware” of the thoughts that arise. “Observe” the arrival of thoughts without applying any emotion or pressure to suppress them. When you “become aware” of your distraction, gently bring your attention back to your breath and focus on the changes in your breathing. The chaotic thoughts will naturally leave your mind, and inner peace will return.

Once you achieve this, congratulations! You have completed a successful meditation session!

## 持How Long Should You Meditate to See Changes?

Everyone’s meditation practice varies, and the time to see changes may differ slightly.
For example, as the author, I often feel tense and anxious due to work. I hoped to improve my anxiety and poor sleep through meditation practice. Driven by curiosity, I initially set practice times of 5-10 minutes per session, 3-4 times a week, viewing meditation as a relaxed, pressure-free practice.

Here are the changes observed after practicing meditation for about 3-4 months:

* After 1 month of practice: On nights I meditated before bed, I seemed to fall asleep faster and more deeply, with fewer dreams.

* After 2 months of practice: I was able to concentrate better during meditation, with fewer distracting thoughts, and felt a warm flow and peace in my heart afterward.

* After 3 months of practice: Although I still occasionally felt anxious at work, I could now quickly let go of my anxiety and restore inner peace, allowing me to focus more calmly and objectively on my tasks.

Even now, having practiced meditation for about a year, I continue to meditate regularly, especially during tough times or high stress. Meditation gives me more confidence to face current situations or challenges, and I believe “the changes brought by meditation occur at every practice moment, and continuous practice accumulates this energy in the body.”

Therefore, regardless of the duration of each practice, as long as you continue and maintain the habit of meditation, you will undoubtedly experience its unique benefits firsthand.
