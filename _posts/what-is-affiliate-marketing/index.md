This article introduces what affiliate marketing is and how to make money through affiliate marketing websites or other means.

## What is Affiliate Marketing?

Affiliate marketing originated from Amazon in 1996. Promoters provide product links, and when readers purchase through these links, the promoters earn commissions. The performance types include CPS, CPC, CPL, and CPA. Unlike advertising, affiliate marketing is based on actual performance billing.

Brands typically allocate marketing budgets across different methods, such as advertising, social media, blogging, and affiliate marketing, adjusting the proportions based on actual performance.

Although affiliate marketing has only recently gained traction in Taiwan, it has become known to the public through promotions by bloggers and YouTubers.

## Common Affiliate Marketing Channels

* Social Media: Build brand awareness on social media platforms and promote product links. Emphasize audience and follower engagement and stay sensitive to trends.
* EDM: If you have an existing audience, directly send messages with product links through EDM.
* Video Content: Share videos on platforms like YouTube, demonstrating product usage and providing links.

## How to Optimize Performance

* Ensure you track all data, such as using Google Analytics to track traffic and utilizing UTM parameters to understand the performance of acquisition channels.
* Use data analysis reports or dashboards from affiliate marketing platforms to analyze the differences between well-performing and poorly-performing products, including article content, messaging, products, and channels.
* Analyze which types of links are more likely to be clicked, such as links embedded in text descriptions or obvious product links.

## Is Affiliate Marketing Profitable?

If you are a promoter capable of creating valuable content, you have the opportunity to profit through this method.

If you frequently introduce or recommend products, consider registering on platforms like VigLink or others to explore partnership opportunities. This income is paid from the brand's original marketing budget, allowing promoters to earn profits while connecting users with suitable products, achieving a win-win situation.
