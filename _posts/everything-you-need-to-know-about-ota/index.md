With the rise of independent travel, the demand for booking websites, services, and discounts is increasing. How do you use these websites? How do you find the hotel that best fits your needs? This article introduces the four most popular online travel agencies (OTAs) and compares their advantages and disadvantages to help you find the most suitable site for booking a hotel.

## [Agoda](https://tinyurl.com/y3o7l83o)

[![agoda-logo](https://i.imgur.com/AC0aCWV.png)](https://tinyurl.com/y3o7l83o)

A professional hotel booking website under Priceline, a famous American travel brand (acquired in 2007), is known as the strongest booking platform in Asia, with a business scope covering China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc.

### Pros

1. Often collaborates with various credit cards, usually providing more rewards than other booking websites.
2. Room rates are paid directly to Agoda, avoiding many fraud issues.
3. Gift voucher system, which can be used to deduct room charges for the next booking.

### Cons

1. The full room rate must be paid before check-in, which is inconvenient for those who prefer to pay at the hotel.
(Currently, the website also provides on-site payment, and the order will be automatically connected to Booking.com of the same group for processing.)
2. Although the customer service has an Asian line, it is very difficult to get through.

## [Booking.com](https://tinyurl.com/y3d9m8fk)

[![go-to-booking.com](https://i.imgur.com/5ri7YYY.png)](https://tinyurl.com/y3d9m8fk)

Through super-strong cross-border mergers and acquisitions, including ActiveHotels.com and [Agoda](https://tinyurl.com/y3o7l83o) acquired in 2004 and 2007 respectively, Booking.com has become the world's largest hotel reservation website.

### Pros

1. Payments are collected by the hotel, allowing for on-site payment and the option to pay in cash.
2. Offers the most diverse selection of accommodations, including hotels, homestays, etc.
3. The user interface is relatively simple, and the booking process is straightforward.
4. Genius Program members receive approximately 10% discount on room rates.

### Cons

1. On-site payments require a credit card reservation guarantee, and the anti-theft mechanisms are relatively incomplete.

## [Ctrip](https://tinyurl.com/y2mzx952)

[![go-to-ctrip](https://i.imgur.com/pIuYjuf.png)](https://tinyurl.com/y2mzx952)

The booking website brand from mainland China, known as [Trip.com](https://tinyurl.com/y2mzx952), features all-inclusive travel agencies, air tickets, and other transportation tickets (Skyscanner), offering comprehensive reservation services.

### Pros

1. The response speed of online customer service is faster than other booking websites.
2. Room reservation network and price comparison network are connected simultaneously, allowing users to book the cheapest room available.

### Cons

1. Prices are displayed in RMB, which may be inconvenient for some users.
2. Prices are relatively cheap in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China, but more expensive in other countries.

## [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/)

[![go-to-expedia](https://i.imgur.com/ZYxOSpB.png)](https://www.expedia.com/)

Looking for a hotel? Trivago! This well-known ad slogan is from Expedia. Its brands include [Hotels.com](https://tinyurl.com/yyg69zbt), [Orbitz.com](https://www.orbitz.com/), and [Trivago](https://www.trivago.com.tw/), among others.

### Pros

* Membership system: Members earn reward points, which can be exchanged for free travel with no date restrictions. Some hotels offer discounts or services to Expedia members.
* "Flight + Hotel" package price discounts.

### Cons

* Although the membership system allows for free travel, the price of single bookings is higher.

## How to Choose the Ideal Booking Website

First, you must understand your own needs for the hotel and choose different booking platforms based on those needs.

### 1. Plan Your Trip

Begin by defining the purpose of your trip, such as a long-term business trip or a family vacation. Your choice of OTA platform largely depends on your purpose.

* Occasionally go out to play and look for low prices - Ctrip, Agoda
* A membership system for frequent or business travelers - Booking.com, Expedia
* Book flight and hotel packages together - Ctrip, Expedia

### 2. Types of Accommodations

After planning the itinerary, you likely have a general preference for the type of hotel. For example, if the trip is a family vacation or a business trip, you can filter for resort/family hotels or business hotels.

* More types of accommodations to choose from (resorts, hotels, homestays, hostels) - Booking.com

### 3. Budget

Just as you plan the itinerary, controlling the budget helps clarify your options. For example, when planning a trip to Tokyo, control the accommodation budget within a specific range and narrow down hotel choices accordingly.

## Common Booking Platform Traps

### Does the Room Rate Include Service Charge and Tax?

In the competition of price cuts on reservation websites, consumers often find that the original discounted price does not include taxes and service fees. Always ensure that the price includes all fees, as service fees are generally 10% of the room rate, and taxes are 5% of the room rate, adding up to 15.5%.

### The Text Trap of the Number of Occupants

Low-priced room rates may display as a text trap for the number of occupants. For example, the rate for two occupants may differ from one, but the lowest price is often advertised, and the consumer is charged the additional cost at check-in.

### Floating Room Rates

Room rates on booking websites are similar to airline ticket prices; they fluctuate. During holidays and high occupancy dates, rates may rise dramatically. Be sure to confirm the final price at checkout.

### Hotel Transportation Location

The location of the hotel with respect to transportation is critical. Some hotels with low prices may lack parking spaces, requiring paid parking. Inconvenient transportation can add significant costs and hassle, ruining the mood of the trip.

### Cancellation Policy

Discounted room rates on booking websites often have strict cancellation policies. If canceled, the full room rate may be charged, similar to non-refundable low-cost airline tickets. The cancellation policy should be considered when booking a hotel.
