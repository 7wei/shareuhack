Due to the prevalence of independent travel, the demands of booking websites, services, and discounts are on the rise. How to use the websites, how do I find the hotel that best fits my needs? Following is an introduction to the four most popular online travel agencies (OTAs). We will compare their advantages and disadvantages to find the most suitable site to book a hotel with.

## [Agoda](https://tinyurl.com/y3o7l83o)

[![agoda-logo](https://i.imgur.com/AC0aCWV.png)](https://tinyurl.com/y3o7l83o)

A professional hotel booking website under Priceline, a famous American travel brand (acquired in 2007), is known as the strongest booking platform in Asia, with business scope: China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc.

### Pros

1. Often cooperate with all kinds of credit cards, and usually provide more feedback than other booking websites
2. The room rate is paid directly to Agoda to avoid many fraud problems
3. Gift voucher system, which can be used to deduct room charges for the next booking

### Cons

1. The full room rate must be paid before check-in, which is inconvenient for those who wish to pay at the store
(Currently, the website also provides on-site payment, and the order will be automatically connected to booking.com of the same group for processing)
2. Although the customer service has opened the Asian line, it is very difficult to get through

## [Booking.com](https://tinyurl.com/y3d9m8fk)

[![go-to-booking.com](https://i.imgur.com/5ri7YYY.png)](https://tinyurl.com/y3d9m8fk)

Relying on super-strong cross-border mergers and acquisitions, ActiveHotels.com and [agoda](https://tinyurl.com/y3o7l83o) was acquired in 2004 and 2007 respectively, which made booking.com the world's largest hotel reservation website.

### Pros

1. The payment is collected by the hotel, paid at the hotel, and the cash payment can be changed at the hotel
2. Hotel selection is the most diverse of all booking platforms, including hotels, homestays, etc.
3. The operation page is relatively simple, and the procedures for completing the order are relatively simple
4. Approximately 10% discount on room rates for Genius Program members

### Cons

1. On-site payment must provide a credit card reservation guarantee, and the anti-theft brush mechanism is relatively incomplete

## [Ctrip](https://tinyurl.com/y2mzx952)

[![go-to-ctrip](https://i.imgur.com/pIuYjuf.png)](https://tinyurl.com/y2mzx952)

The booking website brand from the mainland is known as [Trip.com](https://tinyurl.com/y2mzx952). It features all-inclusive travel agencies, air tickets and other transportation tickets (Skyscanner), which can be arranged for all reservations. The most functional of the website.

advantage:

1. The response speed of online customer service is faster than that of other booking websites
2. The room reservation network and the price comparison network are connected simultaneously, and you can use Ctrip to book the cheapest room at the current time

shortcoming:

1. The price display will be displayed in RMB, which is relatively unchanged in operation
2. The price is relatively cheap in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland, but the price in other countries will be more expensive

## [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/)

[![go-to-expedia](https://i.imgur.com/ZYxOSpB.png)](https://www.expedia.com/)

Looking for a restaurant? Trivago! This well-known ad word is Expediaâ€™s ad. Its brands include [Hotels.com](https://tinyurl.com/yyg69zbt), [Orbitz.com](https://www.orbitz.com/ ), [Trivago](https://www.trivago.com.tw/), etc.

advantage:

* Membership system: Members have reward points, which can be exchanged for free travel and unlimited dates. Some hotels support Expedia members with discounts or services.
* "Flight + Hotel" package price discount.

shortcoming:

* Although there is a membership system in exchange for free travel, the price of a single booking is higher

## How to choose the ideal booking website

First of all, you must first understand your own needs for the hotel and choose different booking platforms for various needs.

### 1. Plan your trip

To begin, we must define the purpose of the trip, such as a long-term business trip or a family vacation. Your choice of OTA platform largely depends on your purpose.

* Occasionally go out to play and look for low prices - Ctrip, Agoda
* A membership system for frequent or business travellers - booking.com, Expedia
* Book flight and hotel packages together - Ctrip, Expedia

### 2. Types of restaurants

After planning the itinerary, I believe that you already have a general preference for the choice of hotels. For example, if the itinerary is a parent-child trip or a business trip, you can filter out the resort/family hotel or business hotel category.

* There are more types of hotels to choose from (resorts, restaurants, homestays, backpackers)-Booking. com

### 3. Budget

As well as planning the itinerary first, controlling the budget will make it clearer in the face of various choices, such as planning a trip to Tokyo and controlling the accommodation budget within a specific range, as well as narrowing the choice of hotels under the preferential room rate.

## Common booking platform traps

### Does the room rate include service charge and tax?

In the competition of price cuts on reservation websites, consumers often find that the original discounted price does not include taxes and service fees. This is because they do not see the price clearly.
The service fee is generally 10% of the room fee, and the tax is 5% of the room fee. When you make a reservation, be sure to read the price that includes all fees since it could add up to 15.5% of the room charge.

### The text trap of the number of occupants

In addition to service fees and taxes, low-priced house prices may also be displayed as a text trap for the number of people staying.
For example, the amount of two stays may be different from that of one stay, but for the benefit of advertising, the lowest price may be displayed first, and the consumer will be charged by the hotel at the time of check-in. The cost is often higher than the room rate when you choose to stay for two at the time of booking.

### Floating house prices

The room rate on the booking website is the same as the concept of buying air tickets. It is not displayed at a fixed price. During holidays and on dates with a high occupancy rate, the room rate will rise dramatically. Therefore, the website will display "starting fromXXX". When paying at the checkout, be sure to confirm the price.

### Hotel transportation location

The location of the hotel with respect to transportation is also very critical. Although some hotels have low prices, they do not have parking spaces. Consumers need to find a paid parking lot for parking. Just imagine that the parking fee for a one-night stay in a hot zone is also very considerable. Inconvenient transportation is not only an additional expense and a lot of hassle, but it also ruined the good mood of the trip.

### Cancellation Policy

In terms of discounts on booking websites, the cancellation policy of cheap room rates is often impossible to cancel. If cancelled, the full room rate will be charged, just like cheap air tickets launched by low-cost airlines, which cannot be refunded. This is the consumer and booking network. As one of the most common consumer disputes, the cancellation policy should also be taken into consideration when booking a hotel.
