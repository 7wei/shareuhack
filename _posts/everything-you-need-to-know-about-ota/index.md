## [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/)

[![go-to-expedia](https://i.imgur.com/ZYxOSpB.png)](https://www.expedia.com/)

Looking for a restaurant? Trivago! This well-known ad word is Expediaâ€™s ad. Its brands include [Hotels.com](https://tinyurl.com/yyg69zbt), [Orbitz.com](https://www.orbitz.com/ ), [Trivago](https://www.trivago.com.tw/), etc.

* Membership system: Members have reward points, which can be exchanged for free travel and unlimited dates. Some hotels support Expedia members with discounts or services.
* "Flight + Hotel" package price discount.

### Cons

* Although there is a membership system in exchange for free travel, the price of a single booking is higher

## How to choose the ideal booking website

First of all, you must first understand your own needs for the hotel and choose different booking platforms for various needs.

### 1. Plan your trip

We must first understand the purpose of this itinerary, such as a long-term business trip or a single-family trip. This is the most important choice when choosing a booking website, including the destination of the itinerary, transportation, and three Meals** etc.

* Occasionally go out to play and pursue low prices-Ctrip, Agoda
* Membership system for frequent or business trips-Booking. com, Expedia
* Include air tickets and hotel packages together booking-Ctrip, Expedia

### 2. Types of restaurants

After planning the itinerary, I believe that you already have a general preference for the choice of hotels. For example, if the itinerary is a parent-child trip or a business trip, you can filter out the resort/family hotel or business hotel category.

* There are more types of hotels to choose from (resorts, restaurants, homestays, backpackers)-Booking. com

### 3. Budget

In addition to planning the itinerary first, the control of the budget will make it clearer in the face of various choices, such as planning a trip to Tokyo, such as controlling the accommodation budget within the specific range and facing hundreds of different Under the preferential room rate, you can narrow the scope of selection to further select the hotel that suits you.

## Common booking platform traps

### Does the room rate include service charge and tax?

In the competition of price cuts on reservation websites, consumers often find that the original discounted price does not include taxes and service fees because they do not see the price clearly.
Generally speaking, the service fee will be charged at 10% of the room fee, and the tax is the room fee + 5% of the service fee. The actual total cost of all kinds of fees is up to 15.5% of the room fee, so be sure to read the price when making a reservation.

### The text trap of the number of occupants

In addition to service fees and taxes, low-priced house prices may also be displayed as a text trap for the number of people staying.
For example, the amount of two stays may be different from that of one stay, but for the benefit of advertising, the lowest price may be displayed first, and the consumer will be charged by the hotel at the time of check-in. The cost is often higher than the room rate when you choose to stay for two at the time of booking

### Floating house prices

The room rate on the booking website is the same as the concept of buying air tickets. It is not displayed at a fixed price. During holidays or on dates with a high occupancy rate, the room rate will rise soaring. Therefore, the website will display "starting from ...". When paying at the checkout, be sure to confirm the price

### Hotel transportation location

When choosing a hotel, the transportation location is also very important. Although some hotels have low prices, they do not have parking spaces. Consumers need to find a paid parking lot for parking. Just imagine that the parking fee for a one-night stay in a hot zone is also very considerable. The amount, or the additional transportation expenses due to the inconvenience of transportation, is not only a cost and a lot of trouble, but also ruined the good mood of the whole trip.

### Cancellation Policy

In terms of discounts on booking websites, the cancellation policy of cheap room rates is often impossible to cancel. If cancelled, the full room rate will be charged, just like cheap air tickets launched by low-cost airlines, which cannot be cancelled. This is the consumer and booking network. One of the most common consumer disputes, so the cancellation policy must also be included in the screening range when booking a hotel.
