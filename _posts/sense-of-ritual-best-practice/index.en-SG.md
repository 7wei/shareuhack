"I clock into work every day and stay at home after getting off work to slide my phone. I really feel that life is so boring." Is this the same for you, waking up every day is full of world-weariness?

In recent years, we have begun to explore the expression of the body, mind, and soul. The term ritual sense has slowly appeared in our lives. We have begun to pursue spiritual abundance. The ritual sense is the performance of pursuing this spirit so that we are no longer just for the sake of To survive but to live for life.

## What is a sense of ritual

That is to give a different spirit to something, and believe in the spiritual satisfaction that this spirit brings.

There are many types of rituals. For example, religious rituals believe that rituals give the future a smooth and stable feeling, and the cohesion generated by the sense of rituals makes people more engaged and believe in the importance of rituals.

For example, athletes gathered in a circle before the game to cheer each other up, and the cohesion generated between the teams made the whole game more steadfast and confident to face their opponents. Different rituals produce a different sense of ritual, which may be cohesion, self-confidence, etc.

In short, the sense of ritual comes from the inner power brought by the ritual that makes people feel unique and sacred. We can apply this concept to our daily life, with the goal of facing our own life with a more serious attitude, and The love I feel from it and the identification of spiritual value, and then I look forward to the ordinary life and live a more exciting life.

After understanding the importance of the sense of ritual, it can also be applied to life. The more common ones are prayer before going to bed, hot coffee in the morning, candle fragrance and so on.

In fact, the sense of ritual is nothing more than adding a sense of expectation to doing something and giving it a special meaning. Even if it is removed, it will not affect the normality of life, but it is like adding seasonings to the **life. The meaning of the sense of ritual is to let Fall in love with life by yourself**

### Even a person is responsible for life with a solemn attitude

For example, due to the recent epidemic, many people started Work Form Home. Since one person stays at home, they think that they don’t need to work in the company as decent as working in the company. Many people will find that their work efficiency is getting worse day by day. At this time, you can try Adjusting some details of life and adding some sense of ritual, such as:

-Even if you are working remotely, you still wear formal attire to go to work
-Separate the rest space from the work area, insist not to use the computer on the bed, and not rest in the work area

After the actual execution for a while, it will be obvious that the body is naturally adjusted to the best state of high efficiency during work. During the rest, the body and mind are not affected by the work, and can relax and form a virtuous circle.

### Planning your own anniversary

There are many general anniversaries, such as Valentine's Day, wedding anniversary, etc. If you can add some of your own anniversaries to your life, you will have a different feeling.
