Every day I clock in at work and then stay at home scrolling through my phone. I feel so bored and disheartened." Do you feel the same, waking up every day filled with a sense of discontent?

In recent years, we've started to explore ways to release our mind and spirit. The concept of "rituals" has begun to appear in our lives. We seek spiritual fulfillment, and rituals are an expression of this pursuit, allowing us to live not just for survival, but to truly live life.

## What is a Sense of Ritual?

It means giving a special meaning to something, believing that this sense of ritual brings spiritual satisfaction.

There are many types of rituals, such as religious ceremonies that bring peace by believing in the blessings they offer. The sense of unity created by rituals makes people more committed and convinced of their importance.

For example, athletes forming a huddle to shout encouragement before a game, creating a sense of unity and confidence to face their opponents. Different rituals create different senses of ritual, such as unity, confidence, etc.

In essence, the sense of ritual comes from the inner strength brought by rituals, making people feel unique and sacred. We can apply this concept to daily life to face our lives with a more serious attitude, feeling the love and recognition of our spiritual values, and thus looking forward to a more exciting life.

## Creating a Sense of Ritual in Daily Life

Understanding the importance of a sense of ritual, we can apply it to our daily lives with common examples like bedtime prayers, morning coffee, or scented candles.

A sense of ritual adds anticipation and special meaning to an activity. Even if removed, it doesn’t affect daily routines. But like adding seasoning to life, the sense of ritual makes you fall in love with living.

### Taking Life Seriously, Even When Alone

Due to the pandemic, many people started working from home. Some might think they don't need to dress formally as they would at the office, leading to decreased work efficiency. Try adjusting small details and adding a sense of ritual to your life, such as:

- Wearing formal clothes even for remote work
- Separating rest areas from workspaces, avoiding using the computer in bed or resting in the work area

After practicing for a while, you'll notice your body naturally adjusting to high efficiency during work and fully relaxing during breaks, creating a positive cycle.

### Plan Your Own Special Anniversaries

There are many common anniversaries like Valentine’s Day or wedding anniversaries. Adding your own special days can bring a different feeling.

For example, designate every Friday as a relaxation day. After a busy workweek, watch a movie you love on Friday night, immersing yourself in it and releasing the week’s accumulated stress.

These life rules will greatly improve your life and work quality. These processes don't require explanations to others but show a responsible attitude toward your own life.

**Respect your life, and life will give you the same value in return.**

## The Positive Cycle of a Sense of Ritual

1. Start by examining your life
2. Create your own rituals
3. Feel a sense of accomplishment after completing tasks
4. Experience joy and recognition from your rituals
5. Gain stability and love from the effects of rituals
6. Reinforce your life with these benefits

**A sense of ritual is like a belief. The process is similar to many religious practices. Making rituals a belief in life will make you love your life even more!**

## Four Key Points to Incorporate a Sense of Ritual into Life

**1. Organize your life before adding rituals**
Everyone has their own pace of life. You need to identify your habits and plan your time to include rituals. Understanding your schedule helps you use and feel the benefits of rituals.

**2. Be consistent**
Research shows that it takes about 21 days to form a habit. Rituals are the same. Maintain them over time to integrate rituals into your life and create a positive cycle.

**3. Start with simple, easy-to-implement rituals**
Don’t complicate rituals at the beginning. They could be a few minutes or a small action. Overcomplicating them may create additional stress.

**4. The sense of ritual comes from internal recognition**
Everyone needs different rituals. Find what resonates with you. For example, many start their day with a cup of coffee, but this might not work for non-coffee drinkers. If life is like a dish, rituals are the seasoning—customize them to your taste.

**Don't overlook the details in life. Living a life with a sense of ritual proves that you haven't given up on life. Start organizing your life and create your unique rituals!**
