It is inevitable for many project managers to have many projects. Knowing how to control the schedule of each project is a topic worth learning. When a project schedule management tool is used, it can have a great impact on organizational efficiency, which will lead to a reduction of waste. Our article will introduce three project schedule management tools in order to help everyone manage the project schedule in an organized way.

## Benefits and advantages of using project management tools

Usually PM will use project management tools in a lot of situations, but if we are ordinary people, when will we use project management tools? In fact, project management tools are very important to everyone. We can use project management tools to plan when we are dealing with big and small things in life, such as camp planning or wedding event planning. Project management tools can help us consider all aspects, provide the functions we need, plan all available resources, and take all stakeholders into consideration.

In addition, the most important aspect of project management tools is that apart from mastering the progress and schedule of each project, there is also a stronger connection between each task and information, and the communication between people is more efficient. Different from the files that come from all directions, the project management tool has a fixed project management space to share information and files, so that team members can communicate and share more conveniently on the platform. At this time, they can get more information through the project management tool. Good collaboration.

## Common project management software tips to share

In addition to understanding how many benefits and advantages project management brings to our lives, I will then introduce you to the three most commonly used project management software, including Slack, Trello and ToDoist. I will not only introduce how to use these three project management software. In addition, I will also introduce you to the advanced features that you have to know!

### Slack introduction, teaching and advanced functions

Slack is a business-specific internal communication tool, originally developed and designed to replace e-mail as the company's main internal communication tool. However, it is also a familiar communication software. Why do most companies choose to use Slack instead of LINE?

If LINE is used as a company's internal communication tool, there will be several pain points:

1. The LINE group usually has too many messages and the screen is washed all the time, so that everyone will not be able to get important news in time
2. When discussing sub-items of a project, the LINE group has to open another group for discussion, so if the project has multiple sub-items for discussion, too many groups will be created.
3. LINE is usually used in private life, and being mixed with company groups often causes trouble for everyone.

Slack, as a communication tool for business, can solve the above-mentioned pain points that LINE cannot solve:

1. Slack can allow you to discuss with the same team or related project personnel through workspaces and channels, and share necessary documents in this channel.
2. Messages can be diverted in Slack's Channel, and each message can use the reply mechanism, so that this topic can be discussed in this branch without affecting the main branch dialogue, so that the entire layout is more organized.
3. Slack is usually a business-specific tool, so it can be clearly distinguished between public and private.

In addition, Slack also has a very useful advanced feature that can work with third-party software, including Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar or Trello can be added to Slack! Just click on "Browse Slack->Applications" and select the application you want to install.

In addition to the free version of Slack, there is also a paid version for the team to choose from.
The biggest difference between the free version and the paid version is that the free version only has 10,000 messages, so if there are too many messages, the team’s past conversation records will not be found. In addition, the paid version can automate the workflow, and also has better security and data protection.

### Trello introduction, teaching and advanced features

Trello is a very useful tool for tracking the progress of the project. It is the main Kanban type. It has Kanban, list, card and other modes, just like sticky notes. Simply drag the project to the current state. See all the progress at a glance (for example: not yet started, in progress and completed), which is a very intuitive project management tool.

Trello is suitable for large projects such as concert planning to small projects such as welcome event planning. For example, if you want to plan a welcome event, you can plan according to the following stages: planning, process, finance, manpower allocation, etc. And set each stage as its own list to complete a very intuitive process.

If you don’t know where to start building a Kanban board, Trello kindly provides an official template and a template shared by netizens. You can directly apply the official template to start scheduling the project. In addition, Trello can also collaborate with third-party software, such as Google Drive, Slack, Jira, or Adobe XD, etc., which can all be added to Trello, which is very convenient.

Among them, Trello also has an advanced feature that can reduce the time it takes to build a Kanban, called Butler. Bulter will automatically help us detect repeated actions on the kanban, and will suggest us to automate these actions and establish rules for subsequent related tasks. For example, Bulter can automatically add the card to the meeting time next Tuesday, add the discussion tag of the meeting, plus the reminder of the meeting record, and finally automatically move the card to the top of the list.

### ToDoist introduction, teaching and advanced functions

ToDoist is a concise and convenient to-do tool. It has a task layering system that can manage large and small projects and their respective tasks in various layers. There is also a filtering system that allows us to focus on specific tasks. ToDoist has a very useful advanced function, that is, collection plug-ins, he can help us quickly collect emails and web pages to the to-do list, so that we can carry out follow-up work.

ToDoist is more suitable for people who are accustomed to using calendar planning, because ToDoist can be combined with Outlook or Google Calendar for comprehensive viewing of the calendar, so that to-do items can be perfectly combined with the calendar, and everyone can more fully control their own Time and schedule.

Among them, ToDoist also has a special incentive mechanism function called Karma Review. As long as you complete your to-do items or tasks, you can get Karma points. The more Karma points you get, you can unlock advanced features, such as tag planning tasks. Or natural language analysis and so on.

## Conclusion

If you need to break the timeline for task dismantling, you can use Trello. If you need to-do list and calendar to assist with homework, ToDoist is suitable. Therefore, you should choose the project management software that suits you best according to your needs!
