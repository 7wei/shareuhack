## What We Do

We are passionate about researching, sharing, and testing practical knowledge and life hacks to help you do everything efficiently and become a LifeHacker!

In today's world, the internet is overflowing with information. Our goal is to provide you with the essential insights needed to achieve your goals efficiently, whether you want to learn workplace skills, cultivate interests, or optimize your life. Our articles aim to help you set a clear direction, reducing the pressure and time cost of learning new things and methods.

Shareuhack is a continuously growing project. We are committed to ensuring that all content on Shareuhack is regularly updated and optimized as you evolve.

## How We Do

1. Each of our articles is researched over several days to weeks, during which we collect and consolidate a large amount of data from credible sources.
2. The products and courses we introduce are tested, understood, or based on actual experiences from experts.
3. We collect feedback and information from interviews with experts in various fields to ensure the accuracy of our information.
4. We regularly review and update the content of older articles to ensure they remain consistent with the latest facts.

## Disclosure

Shareuhack relies on user support to continuously produce content. We have a clear fund reinvestment plan to purchase courses, products, and arrange expert interviews.

When you purchase goods or courses through links on our website, we may benefit from it, including but not limited to commissions from affiliate marketing (e.g., [Affiliates.One](https://vbtrax.com/track/affr/33896)). However, this does not influence our recommendations. Almost all products now offer referral commissions, so it does not bias our choices. Additionally, if readers are not satisfied with our recommendations and return the product, we will not receive any commission. Therefore, Shareuhack will always prioritize our readers.
